## 🔐 Security Layers Explained Simply

Think of our security like a bank:

1. **Encryption** = Vault (passwords locked away safely)
2. **Rate Limiting** = Security Guard (limits access attempts)
3. **File Validation** = X-Ray Machine (checks everything coming in)
4. **CSRF Protection** = ID Verification (ensures requests are legitimate)
5. **CORS Control** = Entry Badges (only authorized visitors allowed)
6. **Error Protection** = Privacy Glass (information stays confidential)
