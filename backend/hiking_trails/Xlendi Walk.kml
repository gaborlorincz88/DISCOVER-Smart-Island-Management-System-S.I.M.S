        <description><![CDATA[This walk starts at L-Imġarr Harbour from in front of the ferry Passenger Terminal. This is the only all-weather harbour in Għawdex (Gozo) and is a constant busy hub with passenger ferries operating regularly to Malta, smaller boats ferrying people to Kemmuna (Comino) and back, as well as a seaplane taking passengers to the Grand Harbour of Il-Belt Valletta. Most of the Gozitan fishing fleet finds a safe berth here sheltered from the most insidious winds as do many pleasure boats moored at the only yacht marina on the island.<br><br>Some traditional fishing boats such as the Maltese Luzzu can still be seen in the harbour in stark contrast with more modern vessels, having abandoned oars and sails to engines it still retains the traditional colours. The specific colours used for the moustache of the fishing boats used to allow for easy recognition of their place of origin. The bow has kept its typical decorations namely depicting the eye of Horus. Said to ward off the evil eye, this ancient seafaring protective measure could possibly have been inherited by the Phoenicians.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[The route starts just opposite the Passenger Terminal and past the Gleneagles Bar. At the top of the few steps leading to the busy main road be very careful in crossing. Take the road on the left under the imposing sanctuary and climb up the first flight of steps on your right.<br><br>Sheltered in a niche in the rockface above is a statue of Our Lady of Lourdes overlooking the harbour. Local folklore has it that this was placed on site after a visitor to the harbour saw a resemblance in these rocks to the grotto of Lourdes – this was in 1879 – just 21 years after the famous appearance to Bernadette in the famous site of pilgrimage in France – indeed still one of the most popular religious destinations for many devout Maltese. It was just a few years later in 1888 when the Blessed Virgin of Mary Lourdes Sanctuary was built as a Gothic church inspired by the basilica in Lourdes. From its parvis the view spreads over the whole harbour with the island of Comino in the background.<br><br>Both L-Imġarr and Comino form part of Għajnsielem Local Council whose parish church above the harbour shares the landscape with the Lourdes church. The next most imposing feature is surely the 18th century fortification of Chambray with its underlying woodland – a rare green sight on the island.<br><br>Continue left past the church along the road adjacent to the woodland. The main trees on the clayey slopes under Fort Chambray are Aleppo Pine, Olive and Eucalyptus some of which were planted in 1963 as a memorial to (Pope John XXIII). The Ministry of Gozo has undertaken a project to enlarge the afforested area with the planting of over 2,000 indigenous trees as part of its EcoGozo projects for a sustainable Gozo.<br><br>At the last pine tree along the road take the left turn up to Fort Chambray to glimpse its massive outer walls. At the time of writing the fortress is being developed into a private residential project and is not accessible. Keep right to rejoin the main road of Għajnsielem, go past the Hostel of Casa San Giuseppe and turn left after the traffic lights into Triq Cordina. Keep right until you reach the junction and take the left road (signposted Diving Wrecks) to Triq il-Fugazz where you can get a good view of the Fort’s flanks and its vedette as well as the underlying clay slopes, terraced fields and varied coast of Ix-Xatt l-Aħmar. Walk down all the way to the coast and before continuing along the coastal route locate the fougasse (stone cannon) cut into the rocky coast just below the road. This spot is a popular diving site where 3 wrecks were sunk as diving attractions and artificial reefs.<br><br>Take a short detour to the left if you would like to see the bay or have a swim in its shallow waters. Several salt pans dot this coast as is practically the case with any low- lying coast on the island.<br><br>Back en route you will be hugging the coast until the next bay of Mġarr ix-Xini. These low cliffs form part of one of Gozo’s geological faults – a reminder of the turbulent geological past of the islands – forces which uplifted hills and formed sunken valleys separating the three main islands and known today as the north and south Comino Channels. The evidence of this can be best seen in the smooth slickenside cliff face when standing at Ras il-Ħobż and looking eastwards. If you go off the path down to the shore do be careful along the eroding clayey cliffs along the small promontory.<br><br>The solitary and barren islet lying off this coast is known as Fessej Rock – here the sea plunges down alongside this pinnacle to a depth of over 50m. Proceed along the coastal path to the 17th century coastal tower of Mġarr ix-Xini. In spring the path is carpeted with small scented flowers of the endemic Maltese Sea Chamomile together with the delightful miniature Barbary Nut Iris. Acting as backdrop to the Tower is the rising mass of majestic limestone cliffs of Ta’ Ċenċ.<br><br>Past the Tower the route follows one of the prettiest old paths on the island – just above the creek amidst the]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[The route follows the only road leading up from the bay and running alongside the valley thus enabling some good views of Wied Ħanżira to the right. An old abandoned water pumping station lies on the valley side*.<br>At about 1.5km inland from the bay take the left turn to start up this steep escarpment created by a major geological fault running below the village of Ta’ Sannat.<br><br>The relatively flat plain beneath is one of the few on the island and it is still an important agricultural area today – the placename Ġnien is-Sultan (the King’s garden) traces its history as far back to the Aragonese times when the land was established as a fief by King Frederick III.<br><br>Past the small lime kiln keep left and at the next crossroad go right past the bus stop. Follow Triq Iċ-Ċnus to its end and head towards the cliffs by taking the rocky path to the right leading to the cliff-edge.<br><br>Keeping a safe distance from the edge do have a stop to enjoy these bewitching natural rock precipices... remembering to also turn your glance inland as this high plateau offers good views towards a good part of the island and Ta’ Sannat itself with its surrounding farms.<br><br>The parish of Ta’ Sannat was established in 1688 and the main church in the village square is dedicated to its patron Saint Margaret whose feast is celebrated every year around the end of July. According to an old tradition, commonly adopted in other places in Gozo, the people of Ta’ Sannat were supposedly converted to Christianity when they heard St. Paul’s voice carried over the land and sea during his preaching on mainland Malta. The first known records of a population established in the village go back to the 17th century.<br><br>The cliffs, which here reach heights of over 140m above sea level are a typical resulting landscape where the hardest, oldest rock layer of the islands – the white Lower Coralline Limestone is exposed in its thickness. In some places the relatively thin capping of the softer yellow Globigerina Limestone can be discerned easily. The karstic landscape forming numerous small hollows in the limestone by rainwater solution are home to important microhabitats forming temporary freshwater pools in the wet season. Some of these support some very rare, indeed endemic plants as well as fascinating creatures such as the little fairy shrimp. The habitat here is mainly garigue with various hardy shrubs observed along the way such as Golden Samphire, Wild Thyme, Bushy Restharrow, Egyptian St. John’s Wort and Olive-leaved Germander. The Sea Squill is a widespread bulbous plant whose leaves are quite strikingly large compared to the miniature leaves of most other garigue species. In autumn the sparse soil cover comes to life with the colourful blossoms of the Mediterranean Meadow Saffron and Autumn Narcissus whilst early spring sees small Sand Crocus and Barbary Nut Iris as well as various orchids.<br><br>The vertical cliffs themselves are home to some of the hardiest of plants such as the succulent salt tolerant endemic Maltese Salt Tree. Cliff hanging species such as Capers and Mediterranean Stonecrop grow on the edge whilst further east at Ta’ Ċenċ the national plant Maltese Rock Centaury can be spotted growing in cracks.<br><br>Your outpost at the jutting point of Il-Pinnur deserves a good stop to take in the surroundings – do keep the placename in mind and be careful on windy days – pinnur means wind-vane and refers to the highly exposed nature of the site to the various winds.<br><br>To the north you can see the fortified Citadel which from this angle does not seem to be on such a high hill as these cliffs climb higher up. To the east the southernmost point of Gozo comes into view – the promontory of Ras in-Newwiela spreading out below the highest point of the cliffs of Ta’ Ċenċ can be observed. This stretch of cliffs down to Ix-Xlendi comes to life on moonless nights in the summer months when hundreds of Scopoli’s Shearwaters return from their fishing day at sea to their nest in one of the many]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[After Tal-Bardan take in the view over to the last section of the cliffs to the west and turn inland to start the descent to the final stretch of the walk down to Ix-Xlendi.<br><br>Follow the concrete path turning inland and then take the path on your left to proceed downhill into the valley known as Wied tal-Kantra flanked by extensive terrace fields making good use of the shelter provided. The terracing of valley sides and hills has probably taken shape over centuries of years and the traditional stone walling technique is the most important skill to be mastered in such a land where soil is extremely scarce and needs to be retained at all costs. The function of these ubiquitous walls of undressed loose stone is to allow rainwater to pass through without carrying away the soil whilst at other places they serve to protect from wind erosion or simply to divide fields and delineate pathways. These walls are an intrinsic feature of the island’s rural heritage. This is also of benefit to the myriad of creatures which actually inhabit the walls or use them for shelter and hiding. These include almost all the reptile species of Malta (snakes, lizards, geckoes, skinks) as well as hedgehogs, shrews and many invertebrates.<br><br>The path leaves the country road to continue on the rocky valley bed of Wied tal-Kantra along the old original path. At the end of the rocky path take the left turn into the terraced fields to reach the promontory of Ras il-Bajjada with another coastal watch tower guarding its tip – the 17th Century Tower is dwarfed by the inaccessible vertical reaches of the next set of cliffs – the foreboding natural fortification of limestone which also stand guard over the bay of Ix-Xlendi. Together with Mġarr ix-Xini, the partly sunken valley of Ix-Xlendi offers the only other accessible coastline for boats. It is suggested that the placename Ix-Xlendi has Byzantine or Arabic connotations to its maritime legacy – Xelandion was a typical seacraft. The deceivingly easy access has claimed many shipwrecks as is attested by a Roman wreck whose amphorae still lie scattered some 60m underwater. The mouth of the bay is the site of a nerve-wracking small reef rising perilously in the middle of it.<br><br>Allow some time to enjoy the promontory beneath the Tower, the nearby salt pans and the curved limestone shaped by the elements – an excellent showcase of the sculpting effect of wind and sea on the softer Globigerina Limestone rock shaping it into smooth surfaces contrasting with the sheer harshness of the harder Lower Coralline Limestone layer forming a great chunk of the cliffs opposite. A set of saltpans carved out of the stone often gets filled with seawater from the raging sea in wild weather – keep your distance in such events.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[Backtracking back inland facing the seaside resort and small fishing village of Ix-Xlendi – a favourite haunt of both tourists and locals alike – you can now find your way back across WiedTal-Kantra via a set of stone cut steps along the valley side leading to an arched stone bridge. The steps can be quite slippery – be careful.<br>In late spring the slopes of the valley are rich in the lilac flowers of the Maltese Stocks. Following the coastal path planted with Tamarisk trees you come to the bay itself. A statue of St. Andrew – patron saint of fishermen – overlooks the bay. The bus stop is just behind the row of seafront buildings.<br><br>At the opposite end of the bay a steep flight of steps leads to the small coastal cave known as Carolina’s Cave. For many years this spot was reserved as a bathing spot for Dominican Nuns. Carolina Cauchi and her family were well known benefactors of the church. Although forming part of the locality of Munxar, Ix-Xlendi celebrates its own feast in honour of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in late August. The church dedicated to Our Lady is dated to 1868 and can be seen standing on the rocky ledge at the start of the hill. Just beneath the church located underground is an unexpected feature – an emergency flour mill excavated into the hard rock in the mid 1950’s.]]></description>

The Order of St. John decided to build a new fortified city at a site overlooking Mgarr harbour capable of accommodating the entire population and their livestock and the military engineer de Tignè was given the task of designing the fortress.<br><br>The funds for the construction of the project were provided by the French knight Jacques Françèois de Chambrai (1687-1756).<br><br>The fortress was designed to deny the landing of an enemy force in the L-Imġarr Harbour area and to keep watch over vessels in the Comino channel. The construction of the fortifications was completed in 1762 but only a few of the projected structures were built and the new city failed to attract residents. It was only once – at the time of Napoleon’s invasion in 1798 that the inhabitants sought refuge here but surrendered and walked out after token resistance. The Fort is currently being developed as a residential area.]]></description>

Completed in 1661 the tower resembles closely the slightly earlier set of 13 coastal towers in Malta erected by Grand Master De Redin.<br><br>During the Knights’ period the tower carried two iron guns and had a garrison of three men. It kept watch over the Gozo-Comino channel and served to raise an early alarm in case of an incursion – which for centuries was a very likely occurrence especially with the nearby creek offering an easy landing sheltered from the prevailing northwest wind. The fear was also founded in bitter experience as just a century earlier the whole of Gozo had been depopulated and taken into slavery during a siege by the Ottomans. Tradition has it that the nearby promontory is thought to have been the site were over 5000 Gozitans were shipped to Tripoli as slaves. After the Order’s departure the guards were provided by the Royal Malta Fencible Regiment up to the 1870’s but thereafter the tower tended to be abandoned. It briefly resumed its original role when, during World War II, it was used as a coast observation post by the Gozo Coastal Police. The Tower was restored in 1999 on the initiative of Wirt Għawdex, a local voluntary heritage organization and part of the funds were raised by sponsorships of inidvidual blocks of stone. The tower can be visited by appointment via e-mail to info@wirtghawdex.org or by visiting the website (www.wirtghawdex.org) for opening times. The Tower is open if the flag is flying.]]></description>

The main function of the tower was to prevent smuggling and other contraband activity such as landing by evaders of quarantine as well as to raise the alarm when corsairing vessels were seen approaching. Entrance to the tower was by means of an elevating drawbridge now replaced by a masonry stone bridge connecting the tower to the stairway. The tower’s last military role was played in World War II when it was used as a coast observation post manned by the Gozo Coastal Police. After the war, the tower began to be leased to private persons. The tower is undergoing restoration upon the initiative of the heritage organisation Din l-Art Ħelwa and Munxar Local Council.]]></description>

The one at Ix-Xlendi is the only one to be found in Gozo.<br><br>All were built away from the danger zones of the harbour in Malta. A tunnel was dug some 30m deep into the rock and a chamber was excavated to be divided into 3 floors. The silo had a capacity of 1000tons. This mill has been restored by the Munxar Local Council and plans are underway to open it up for the public on a regular basis.]]></description>

Completed in 1661 the tower resembles closely the slightly earlier set of 13 coastal towers in Malta erected by Grand Master De Redin.<br><br>During the Knights’ period the tower carried two iron guns and had a garrison of three men. It kept watch over the Gozo-Comino channel and served to raise an early alarm in case of an incursion – which for centuries was a very likely occurrence especially with the nearby creek offering an easy landing sheltered from the prevailing northwest wind. The fear was also founded in bitter experience as just a century earlier the whole of Gozo had been depopulated and taken into slavery during a siege by the Ottomans. Tradition has it that the nearby promontory is thought to have been the site were over 5000 Gozitans were shipped to Tripoli as slaves. After the Order’s departure the guards were provided by the Royal Malta Fencible Regiment up to the 1870’s but thereafter the tower tended to be abandoned. It briefly resumed its original role when, during World War II, it was used as a coast observation post by the Gozo Coastal Police. The Tower was restored in 1999 on the initiative of Wirt Għawdex, a local voluntary heritage organization and part of the funds were raised by sponsorships of inidvidual blocks of stone. The tower can be visited by appointment via e-mail to info@wirtghawdex.org or by visiting the website (www.wirtghawdex.org) for opening times. The Tower is open if the flag is flying.]]></description>

The Order of St. John decided to build a new fortified city at a site overlooking Mgarr harbour capable of accommodating the entire population and their livestock and the military engineer de Tignè was given the task of designing the fortress.<br><br>The funds for the construction of the project were provided by the French knight Jacques Françèois de Chambrai (1687-1756).<br><br>The fortress was designed to deny the landing of an enemy force in the L-Imġarr Harbour area and to keep watch over vessels in the Comino channel. The construction of the fortifications was completed in 1762 but only a few of the projected structures were built and the new city failed to attract residents. It was only once – at the time of Napoleon’s invasion in 1798 that the inhabitants sought refuge here but surrendered and walked out after token resistance. The Fort is currently being developed as a residential area.]]></description>

It enjoys spectacular views of the Gozo Channel and the Island of Malta and can be easily reached on foot or by car from the harbour or from the village of Għajnsielem.<br><br>A statue of the Virgin Mary of Lourdes sculpted by Antonio Busuttil was placed in a natural cavity beneath the promontory in 1879. On 3rd June 1888, it was blessed by Bishop Pietro Pace who urged devotees to help him raise a chapel. The foundation stone was laid just one week later and the chapel opened in summer 1893. It was consecrated in 1949.<br><br>Designed by Emmanuel Galizia and built by stonemason Wiġi Vella of Żebbuġ, the chapel has a Gothic style with a steeply pitched roof, lance windows and a series of buttresses topped with pinnacles. A circular rose window adorns the gable over the main door while, at the other end, a square tower is topped by a tall, slender spire. The tower has a set of five bells and at its top, immediately under the spire, there are four clock faces.<br><br>Inside, the chapel has a ribbed Gothic vaulted roof and is dominated by a statue of the Virgin Mary of Lourdes. This statue was sculpted by Carlo Darmanin and donated by Karolina Mamo-Bruno in 1893.<br><br>The feast is celebrated on the 11th February, the date of the first apparition of Lourdes. Throughout the feast many people from all over the island flock to the chapel to hear mass and pray.]]></description>

This wreck stands perfectly upright and approximately 80 metres from the dive’s entry point. There is plenty to explore on its three decks. The top deck starts at a depth of 30m and the sandy bottom is at 40m to 42m. The nearby reef offers an excellent way to continue the dive, gradually ascending along the wall and providing a safety stop on the 5m-deep plateau above.<br><br>The 39m-long MV Cominoland, an old ferry used for tourist day-trips round Comino, was scuttled in August 2006 to form an artificial reef on Gozo’s south-east coast approximately 80 metres from the entry point. The wreck stands perfectly upright and the two decks offer plenty of potential for exploration. The sandy bottom around the wreck is home to rays, gurnards and giant tuns. This wreck starts at 32m and the maximum depth around the Cominoland is 40m. The nearby reef offers an excellent way to continue the dive, gradually ascending along the wall with a useful safety stop on a plateau 5m below the surface. ]]></description>
