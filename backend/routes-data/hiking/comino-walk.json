Historically a preferred hideaway by corsairs, Comino is now a haven for birds and tranquillity — hunting is not allowed, nor are vehicles other than those used by the resident population or by hotel staff. Currently the main island has a permanent population of three people and a seasonal hotel operates from San Niklaw Bay. The short walking route described here is a circular one which starts and ends at Bejn il-Kmiemen (Blue Lagoon) in an anticlockwise direction. The trail follows the main pathways but can easily be extended by going off the beaten track to explore the island in more detail especially along the wild cliffs on the east side. The Blue Lagoon is the most popular site among day trippers — it can get quite crowded on sunny days as early as May but otherwise few people venture along the coast or into the heart of Comino.]]>",

If you want to enjoy a swim the best time is as soon as you get here with the first boat — in sunny weather the deserted beach will be transformed into a busy space by midday and will hardly be recognisable.<br><br>Less than 200 meters away lies the sister islet of Kemmunett (Cominotto), the diminutive for Kemmuna.

      "description": "<![CDATA[Leaving the turquoise hues behind you head up to the right to start your walk alongside the coast and its string of attractive islets which despite their hardstone nature are all subject to the forceful action of the waves piercing holes right through. Just be cautious along a few stretches where the terrain may be a bit tricky. The garigue vegetation becomes more widespread and diverse as you proceed along this aromatic path of wild plants whose dwarf shrubs are ideal hiding and resting places for the population of Maltese Wall Lizards which race you along the way. On warm sunny days this is also a good place to spot the black Western Whip Snake, as it basks in the sun gathering its energy. The four species of snake known from the Maltese Islands are protected by law as are all reptile species in Malta. None of them is considered as poisonous.<br><br>Heading towards the sombre tower crowning the majestic cliffs of Western Comino, the path continues upwards along the cliff. Keeping a safe distance away from the fragile edge do have a look or go down to the crystal clear waters of the next popular spot for pleasure boats — the Crystal Lagoon — known locally as Il-Bejta tal-Fenek (the rabbit’s nest). Indeed the island is renowned for its wild rabbit population which are easier spotted here rather than on the main islands. <br><br>The path goes close to one of the few valleys of the island — Il-Wied ta’ Skalanova (the valley of the new port). If you are in an adventurous mode to explore the rugged terrain venture offroute down the valley slope but be warned — there is a massive gaping hole in the rock measuring more than 20 meters in width and lying open just below. This collapsed limestone cave, aptly called L-Għar ta’ Bla Saqaf (the roofless cave), connects to the sea below via a large natural arched entrance home now to several wild pigeons. At sea level, seen only from a boat, is a small hidden pebble cove - one of the many backdrops to the film the Count of MonteCristo (2002) whose Château d’If was the nearby tower. The narrow promontory of land offers striking views to the tower and vertiginous cliffs below including the massive stack of Il-Mazz — probably what remains of a large eroded arch. The valley is one of the few sheltered pockets of this windswept area and is a good hiding place not only for rabbits or reptiles but also, it seems, for soldiers in wartime. Locals remember them posted on guard here in two rock cut chambers excavated in the valley side — features which are as yet undated and unclassified but nevertheless interesting as at first glance they resemble ancient rock tombs. Despite the small surface area of the island to date no extensive archaeological survey has been carried out. <br><br>Proceeding towards the Santa Marija Tower the Shrubby Kidney Vetch colours the landscape yellow with many tiny flowers in Spring whilst the high and exposed plateau is enlivened by minute Scarlet and Blue Pimpernels. To the left lies the inhabited section of the island. Don’t miss a visit to the Knights’ seventeenth century tower when the flag is flying — the view from the roof is breathtaking. And if you have planned for a longer stay on the island don’t miss the appointment with sunset from these wild cliffs. <br><br>Best seen from roof of tower is the whole landscape of the island with the highest section rising in the East. A striking feature is the large number of dry stone walls traversing the island — a sign of agricultural activity of the past. Most of the land today is largely abandoned — some areas which where under cultivation are slowly being taken over again by wild plants but in many areas the discontinuation of farming has resulted in soil erosion as dry stone walls lacking maintenance collapse and lose their soil retaining role.]]>"

Built in 1618, and enlarged in 1667 and again in 1716, the chapel was originally dedicated to the Annunciation. It has been deconsecrated and reconsecrated at least once in its history, when Comino was devoid of residents. The earliest record of a chapel on this site dates back to the 12th century, and can be seen in a navigational map of the period, located in the National Maritime Museum and Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London.<br><br>In the past, and well into the 20th century, whenever the seas were too rough for the Gozitan priest to make the crossing to Comino for the celebration of Holy Mass, the local community would gather on the rocks at a part of the Island known as Tal-Ħmara, and gaze across the channel towards the Chapel of Our Lady of the Rocks (Maltese: il-Madonna tal-Blat), in Ħondoq ir-Rummien, Gozo, where Mass was being celebrated. They followed the Mass by means of a complex flag code.<br><br>Looking at the church from the outside one sees a very primitive, plain church however the interior of the church contrasts with the exterior. The interior is constructed on a Neo-Gothic style, with pointed archways. The sanctuary is separated from the main body of the church by an Iconostasis, one of the few churches left with it intact, indicating its origins at a time when the Maltese Church fell under the Byzantine Church. The main painting depicts the return of the Holy Family from Egypt and has influences from Francesco Zahra. It was restored in 1928 by Vincenzo Bonello. The church has one altar and three statues, the Virgin Mary, the Sacred Heart and Saint Joseph.<br><br>Researched and written by Federica Fluca<br><br><img src=\"https://mymaps.usercontent.google.com/hostedimage/m/*/3ADbDBKtR_uBbAxvKEXfTQY2wHk1C5gDRT22xUjz8dGlMPpPbiMeL9s7tKmSMWzsmj4xmbfpzraKiQZHTrvisvmRX7AA1aAZJhn9_MhoRxhanRnD5kJqF0O3-KR15ywgg8vN6Rz6z70Bo9G5We6F5Oet2z1zfHGpwCCWwONZzHQgsHgHW2MzuPvfS0bxl56aWK14Z7CGauhMMR2kP1g?authuser=0&fife=s16383\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" />]]>"
