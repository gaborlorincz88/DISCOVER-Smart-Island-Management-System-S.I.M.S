The scenic walk takes on some beautiful views over to Comino as you walk up from sea level to Il-Qala Belvedere as well as far reaching views from the Maltese Garden located on the high plateau of In-Nadur surrounding Kenuna Tower. Although the walking is relatively easy, mainly on established roads and paths, it does involve a series of uphills and downhills. Definitely recommended is a stop at the small bay of Ħondoq ir-Rummien where, if weather permits in the warmer months, do stop for a dip into its clean, clear waters. This is the only sandy pocket where locals can enjoy a swim when the prevailing northwesterly wind blows. On your way through the village cores take some time to savour local village life in the main square or go off-route to explore the place better – In-Nadur for instance holds an interesting Maritime Museum.<br><br>If you need any short cuts there are buses linking the villages to the bus terminus in Victoria or to L-Imġarr Harbour.<br><br>For the more adventurous a rough coastal path starting from the clay slopes at the eastern end of the harbour can provide an alternative to the road for getting to Ħondoq ir- Rummien – however short stretches of it are quite narrow and subject to constant erosion.]]>",

      "description": "The walk starts from just outside the Passenger Terminal in the picturesque L-Imġarr Harbour. Cross the road and head towards the moorings. The small traditional boats with their vivid colours dot the harbour in stark contrast with the giant modern ferries sailing restlessly to and from Malta. L-Imġarr is the only all-weather harbour of the island and has always provided a vital link to Malta with its ferry boats carrying passengers, cattle and goods. It is still an important fishing base for locals as well as a departing point for various day trips around the island and ferrying of passengers to Kemmuna (Comino) and it holds the only yacht marina on the island. Many locals come down to the harbour in the weekends to watch the buzzing activity but also to enjoy the numerous restaurants which have opened up. Hidden amongst other modern boats lies a relic of past times when the wooden Gozo boat used to be the only means of travel between the islands. The Knights of St John constructed two stores here and manifested their preference for a coastal and strategic location by investing heavily in the imposing Fort Chambray built high above the harbour in 1749 with the unfulfilled intention of it serving as the new city of Gozo."

For a few minutes it engulfs you in its rustic ambience amidst dry stone walls and lush vegetation — a microcosm seemingly trapped in times gone by when the area around the harbour was known as Ġnien Migiarro (L-Imġarr’s Garden), so distant from the bustle and developments between which it is actually sandwiched. Among the foliage you can catch glimpses of the imposing Fort Chambray and the Lourdes Sanctuary overlooking the harbour whilst the cliff side holds a few rock cut caves some of which are still in use by farmers to store tools and produce. The winding stone path passes in between miniature fields and giant Carob trees and is surrounded by Fig, Prickly Pear and shrubs of Tree Spurge which colour the landscape with autumn hues of amber and red in May. In winter you will come across the broad luxuriant and shiny leaves of the Acanthus – known commonly as the Bear’s Breeches – the design of which was immortalised in Corinthian style columns. At the end of summer its exploding seeds may surprise you as they burst open and land metres away from the plant. The large collapsed boulders form interesting natural rock gardens with Caper and Mediterranean Stonecrop.<br><br>At the top of the steps take care in the narrow main road and continue uphill. Take the first turn right into Triq iż-Żewwieqa. The road crosses a small valley which on the seaward side supports one of the few populations of Chaste Tree which take over the whole valley bed. You will encounter this otherwise rare tree at closer range further on along the walk. On the landward side of this small bridge lies a dense thicket of Almond, Carob, Olive, Chaste Tree and Buckthorn trying to hold their ground amidst the sea of Giant Reed. Above the valley on the left stand the church and friary of St. Anthony (which also functions as a retreat house) and the high plateau above is your destination later on in the walk when you get to the village of In-Nadur. The road proceeds to Il-Qala whose belvedere looks over one of the most stunning views in the archipelago over sloping terraced fields and, across the channel, the famous turquoise waters of Bejn il-Kmiemen (Blue Lagoon) which separate the island of Kemmuna from its smaller sister Kemmunett.]]>"

It retained sails till the 1950s even though engines had started to be fitted on it since 1919. At 47 feet long and allowing for a 30 tonne cargo these boats were built to last a lifetime, enduring the rough seas prevailing in the channels in windy weather. As with other traditional boats it was painted in green, blue, red and yellow whilst a completely black one was used to transport the dead. The moustache on the bow was decorated with the traditional eye of Horus – to protect from the evil eye.<br><br>The last known Gozo Boat in existence, dating to 1933 and built by Maltese boatbuilders is the Sacra Famiglia which after years of lying decaying in the harbour is now thankfully restored and is on permanent display at the harbour as part of an initiative of the local voluntary organization Wirt Għawdex in conjunction with Gozo Channel.]]>"
