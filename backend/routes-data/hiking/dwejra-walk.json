Buses leave regularly from the harbour to Victoria and back. The route can also be shortened by taking a return bus from San Lawrenz or Dwejra.<br><br>Recommended Walking season: October to May<br><br><br>Overview<br><br>Starting and ending at Victoria this walk takes you to the westernmost coast of Gozo to the scenic Dwejra Heritage Park – a haven for geology and ecology enthusiasts or simply anyone enjoying natural views. Amongst the highlights here are the historically famous Fungus Rock and its sentinel - the Knights’ coastal watchtower, the sculpted 40 meters high natural arch known as the Azure Window, the unique Inland Sea with boat trips taking visitors through a natural tunnel, ancient collapsed caverns, fossil beds and very rare endemic plants including the only place in the world where you can observe the endemic plant the Maltese Everlasting. All of this is contained in a relatively small area surrounded by steep limestone cliffs. In the warmer months, when the sea is tranquil Dwejra is one of the best diving sites and a beautiful place for swimming, snorkelling or enjoying sunset. The route takes you in the narrow maze in Victoria, the lush valley of Wied il-Lunzjata and the villages of Ta’ Kerċem and San Lawrenz as well as the nearby hamlet of Santa Luċija.]]>",

It is the place where one can meet different people, from locals taking their morning coffee and pastizzi (traditional savoury pastry filled with ricotta cheese or mashed peas) to visitors checking out the stalls of the small open air market. The Ficus trees, found in Independence Square are home to hundreds of Spanish Sparrows. At sunset, one can observe the chattering Spanish Sparrows flocking back to their nests. <br><br>The semi-circular building of the Banca Giuratale (1730’s), now housing the Culture Information Centre and the Victoria Local Council, was the seat of the municipal government of Gozo. Cultural exhibitions are often held inside the building.

      "description": "<![CDATA[The route takes you through some of the narrow winding streets of the city starting from the next most popular square known as Pjazza San Ġorġ (Saint George’s Square) dominated by the parish church, the pride of many locals – the basilica dedicated to the same saint. Take the street on the right of the church and then the second on the right into Triq il-Providenza. Turn left into Triq il-Librerija and then right into Triq San Ġwann. As with all other traditional villages in the Maltese Islands, these narrow roads typically hold several holy niches showing the devotion to various saints but especially to Our Lady.<br><br>Be careful as you come out at the end of the labyrinthine streets to cross the busy road to Triq San Ġwann Bosco. Follow this road down to Gozo’s green heart – the most fertile valley lying between Fontana and Ta’ Kerċem, Wied il-Lunzjata, literally translated as the Valley of the Annunciation thus named after the chapel still found on the valley side. Take a few minutes to detour through the gateway and enjoy the area before proceeding back up en route and across the valley.<br><br>The arched entrance dates back to the time of the Knights of St. John in 1698 during the reign of Grand Master Perellos y Roccaful when part of the valley was walled to restrict access to their recreational area. The locality holds some of the most plentiful springs and vegetable gardens on the island. The premises above the arch now serve as the premisses of the Education, Science & Culture Centre. An interesting sundial on the wall is a replica of the oldest sundial found in Gozo dating to 1546 the original of which is found in Xewkija. The enigmatic letters ENCHOR are still the subject of speculation.<br><br>Various caves carve the valley side and it seems one such cave held the original troglodytic chapel, one of the oldest on the island dating to 1347 and also dedicated to the Annunciation. In 1370 the chapel became part of a royal benefice under the Kings of Sicily. The present day chapel dates to 1629 and has a simple modest facade with an oculus above the door. Later on a small sacristy and belfry were added. In the Catholic world the longstanding popular Marian cult of the Annunciation dates back to the fifth century and it is still widely celebrated in Malta with a liturgical feast on 25th March. Today mass is held regularly in this chapel which remains the only surviving one in Gozo dedicated to the Annunciation where the feast is celebrated annually.<br><br>The picturesque valley was originally known as Is-Saqqajja – a direct reference to its numerous freshwater springs serving as a unique haven for lush vegetation all year round with vegetable gardens and abundant reeds, olive, almond, pomegranate and carob trees. The watercourse joins up with Xlendi Valley further down and is home to one of the rarest species in the Maltese Islands – the endemic Maltese Freshwater Crab, as well as the only native amphibian of the islands: the Painted Frog.<br><br>Water has always been a very scarce resource in Malta and it was guarded closely and harvested with great care, redirecting some springs to channel them into systems of canals to serve local cultivation but also to supply the local fountain built in 1698 which can be seen at the end of the track in the valley. Two coats of arms can be seen – the top one bearing three pears belongs to Grand Master Perellos y Roccaful and the other belongs to the Testaferrata noble family, a member of whom had been appointed to build it. The fountain was restored by Din l-Art Ħelwa in 2007. The adjacent stone troughs still serve their original purpose to local farmers – it is not unusual to see them brimming with parsley or other crops kept fresh in this cool spring water.]]>",

It was mentioned in notarial deeds of 1479. Other sources trace this church to the time of Count Roger I of Sicily. The church was rebuilt in 1502. Together with that of St. James and St. George's, this church served as the parish church for the locals during the night time since the parish of St. Mary in the Cittadella was inaccessible for people living outside the fortified city. As the threat of a barbarian invasion decreased, Savina and St. James's lost their parochial status and Victoria was left with two main parishes. Burials used to take place in the church yard up until 1899.<br><br>The present church was built in the early 20th century. The cathedral chapter had approved plans for the rebuilding of Savina church. Works started in 1901 and finished in 1904. The church was consecrated on February 17, 1904. In 1913 the church was further enlarged. The church reopened on the same year by Cardinal Domenico Ferrata, a Papal delegate for the Eucharistic Congress. Monsignor Luigi Vella was appointed as the first rector of the church. Monsignor Vella was the one who worked to rebuild the church and open it for perpetual adoration. He later was appointed as Archdeacon of the cathedral.<br><br>The church building is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.]]>",

The Tower is 35 feet square and rises to a height of 30 courses. It has an architecturally unique platform jutting out seawards.<br><br>The Tower was armed with two 6-pounder iron guns that were later replaced with two 4-pounders. The Tower had its own Capo Mastro (Detachment Commander) and a Bombardier (gunner), who in turn had his own Aggiuntante. At night the Tower was itself guarded by three more armed men. From the rising cliffs of Ras il-Bajda, the tower commands an extensive view of the south-western approaches to Gozo and the entrance to the Comino Channel.
