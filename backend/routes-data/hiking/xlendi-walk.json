At the top of the few steps leading to the busy main road be very careful in crossing. Take the road on the left under the imposing sanctuary and climb up the first flight of steps on your right.<br><br>Sheltered in a niche in the rockface above is a statue of Our Lady of Lourdes overlooking the harbour. Local folklore has it that this was placed on site after a visitor to the harbour saw a resemblance in these rocks to the grotto of Lourdes – this was in 1879 – just 21 years after the famous appearance to Bernadette in the famous site of pilgrimage in France – indeed still one of the most popular religious destinations for many devout Maltese. It was just a few years later in 1888 when the Blessed Virgin of Mary Lourdes Sanctuary was built as a Gothic church inspired by the basilica in Lourdes. From its parvis the view spreads over the whole harbour with the island of Comino in the background.<br><br>Both L-Imġarr and Comino form part of Għajnsielem Local Council whose parish church above the harbour shares the landscape with the Lourdes church. The next most imposing feature is surely the 18th century fortification of Chambray with its underlying woodland – a rare green sight on the island.<br><br>Continue left past the church along the road adjacent to the woodland. The main trees on the clayey slopes under Fort Chambray are Aleppo Pine, Olive and Eucalyptus some of which were planted in 1963 as a memorial to (Pope John XXIII). The Ministry of Gozo has undertaken a project to enlarge the afforested area with the planting of over 2,000 indigenous trees as part of its EcoGozo projects for a sustainable Gozo.<br><br>At the last pine tree along the road take the left turn up to Fort Chambray to glimpse its massive outer walls. At the time of writing the fortress is being developed into a private residential project and is not accessible. Keep right to rejoin the main road of Għajnsielem, go past the Hostel of Casa San Giuseppe and turn left after the traffic lights into Triq Cordina. Keep right until you reach the junction and take the left road (signposted Diving Wrecks) to Triq il-Fugazz where you can get a good view of the Fort’s flanks and its vedette as well as the underlying clay slopes, terraced fields and varied coast of Ix-Xatt l-Aħmar. Walk down all the way to the coast and before continuing along the coastal route locate the fougasse (stone cannon) cut into the rocky coast just below the road. This spot is a popular diving site where 3 wrecks were sunk as diving attractions and artificial reefs.<br><br>Take a short detour to the left if you would like to see the bay or have a swim in its shallow waters. Several salt pans dot this coast as is practically the case with any low- lying coast on the island.<br><br>Back en route you will be hugging the coast until the next bay of Mġarr ix-Xini. These low cliffs form part of one of Gozo’s geological faults – a reminder of the turbulent geological past of the islands – forces which uplifted hills and formed sunken valleys separating the three main islands and known today as the north and south Comino Channels. The evidence of this can be best seen in the smooth slickenside cliff face when standing at Ras il-Ħobż and looking eastwards. If you go off the path down to the shore do be careful along the eroding clayey cliffs along the small promontory.<br><br>The solitary and barren islet lying off this coast is known as Fessej Rock – here the sea plunges down alongside this pinnacle to a depth of over 50m. Proceed along the coastal path to the 17th century coastal tower of Mġarr ix-Xini. In spring the path is carpeted with small scented flowers of the endemic Maltese Sea Chamomile together with the delightful miniature Barbary Nut Iris. Acting as backdrop to the Tower is the rising mass of majestic limestone cliffs of Ta’ Ċenċ.<br><br>Past the Tower the route follows one of the prettiest old paths on the island – just above the creek amidst the]]>"

Completed in 1661 the tower resembles closely the slightly earlier set of 13 coastal towers in Malta erected by Grand Master De Redin.<br><br>During the Knights’ period the tower carried two iron guns and had a garrison of three men. It kept watch over the Gozo-Comino channel and served to raise an early alarm in case of an incursion – which for centuries was a very likely occurrence especially with the nearby creek offering an easy landing sheltered from the prevailing northwest wind. The fear was also founded in bitter experience as just a century earlier the whole of Gozo had been depopulated and taken into slavery during a siege by the Ottomans. Tradition has it that the nearby promontory is thought to have been the site were over 5000 Gozitans were shipped to Tripoli as slaves. After the Order’s departure the guards were provided by the Royal Malta Fencible Regiment up to the 1870’s but thereafter the tower tended to be abandoned. It briefly resumed its original role when, during World War II, it was used as a coast observation post by the Gozo Coastal Police. The Tower was restored in 1999 on the initiative of Wirt Għawdex, a local voluntary heritage organization and part of the funds were raised by sponsorships of inidvidual blocks of stone. The tower can be visited by appointment via e-mail to info@wirtghawdex.org or by visiting the website (www.wirtghawdex.org) for opening times. The Tower is open if the flag is flying.]]>"

This wreck stands perfectly upright and approximately 80 metres from the dive’s entry point. There is plenty to explore on its three decks. The top deck starts at a depth of 30m and the sandy bottom is at 40m to 42m. The nearby reef offers an excellent way to continue the dive, gradually ascending along the wall and providing a safety stop on the 5m-deep plateau above.<br><br>The 39m-long MV Cominoland, an old ferry used for tourist day-trips round Comino, was scuttled in August 2006 to form an artificial reef on Gozo’s south-east coast approximately 80 metres from the entry point. The wreck stands perfectly upright and the two decks offer plenty of potential for exploration. The sandy bottom around the wreck is home to rays, gurnards and giant tuns. This wreck starts at 32m and the maximum depth around the Cominoland is 40m. The nearby reef offers an excellent way to continue the dive, gradually ascending along the wall with a useful safety stop on a plateau 5m below the surface. ]]>"
