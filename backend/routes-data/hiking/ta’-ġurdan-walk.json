Buses leave regularly from the harbour to Victoria where a bus can be taken to L-Għarb and back.<br><br>Recommended Walking season: October to May<br><br>Overview<br><br>This circular walk starts and ends in the village square of L-Għarb. The road running down the left-hand side of the church leads to open countryside, passing the “St. Dimitri Chapel” and affording good views of “Ta’ Ġurdan Lighthouse” and “Ta’ Pinu Sanctuary”. The valley of “Wied il-Mielaħ” is reached after a nice walk along the coast. The hilly features of the island and the view of the vast expanse of sea stretching beyond the steep cliffs are best enjoyed from the top of Ta’ Ġurdan Hill. This walk leads on to the magnificent valley of “Wied il-Għasri”, ensconced between sheer cliffs, followed by Ta’ Ġurdan Lighthouse. This imposing landmark affords a bird’s-eye view of most of the island. Eventually the walk leads to the “Ta’ Pinu Sanctuary” a centre of religious devotion and ex-voto offerings. The road through the fields behind the sanctuary leads back to the centre of the village where the walk began. The route map in the centre pages of this booklet, together with the many signposts along the route, will help you to follow the walk more easily. Sticking to the set route affords a fascinating cross-section of Gozitan countryside, folklore and traditions.]]>",

The quaint, distinctive feel of the square is enhanced by the parish church dedicated to the Visitation of Our Lady.

One of its two belfries displays in bold letters the message “Ibni għozz iz-zmien” (Cherish time, my son).<br><br>The concave facade is adorned with intricate sculpture and carved around the main door are the symbols of Faith, Hope and Charity.

From the village square, follow the road called Triq Madonna tal–Virtu’ flanking the left-hand side of the church. Going downhill you will notice the facades of recently built houses, especially those bearing the names of foreign countries and cities, such as Australia or the United States of America. These are owned by returned migrants who left the Maltese islands in search of a better life in lands of opportunity. The variety of balconies and terraces is striking. Triq Madonna tal–Virtu’ levels out at a crossroads. Our walk continues straight ahead along Triq Birbuba.<br><br>Along this road is a children’s playground named after Pope John Paul II, the only Pope ever to have visited Gozo. From here you can observe the “Wied ir-Raħeb”, the Hermit’s Valley or the Sacristan’s Valley.<br><br>Continue along Triq Birbuba and when you arrive at a Y-junction take the right fork. Proceeding along the road, between dry-stone walls, you will start to see in the distance the “Ta’ Ġurdan Lighthouse” towering above the undulating landscape.<br><br>After about 400 meters you turn right on to a footpath and after less than 200 meters you turn left on to a dusty path which leads towards the San Dimitri chapel. Turning right at the crossroads you come to the chapel, which dates back to the 15th century. The altarpiece shows St. Demetrius on horseback. The high ground on which the chapel stands provides a breathtaking view of L-Għarb, Ta’ Pinu Sanctuary, Ta’ Ġurdan Lighthouse, Iż-Żebbuġ and quarries that were formerly used to extract prime yellow globigerina limestone and have now been restored to agricultural use. Going back to the crossroads, take the road that turns to the right toward the northern coast. Not far in the distance you can observe a circular row of Following the footpath you arrive at a T-junction where you turn left. This path runs downhill through heavily eroded yellowish globigerina limestone and clay. Ahead you see a group of large boulders which appear to be stone megaliths but are actually just natural boulders. Proceed towards the coast and then turn right towards the yellow limestone coast, entering a landscape of wind-sculpted limestone.<br><br>The geological and geomorphological features of the site are such that the landscape shaped by the erosive action of wind and rainwater can be described as “lunar”.]]>"

A young lad, the only son of a peasant who lived close to the chapel, was captured and taken into captivity. His desperate mother rushed to the chapel and passionately implored San Dimitri to redeem her son from slavery. The woman made a solemn vow that she would provide oil for the chapel’s lamp every single day of her life. Miraculously the images of the saint and his horse came to life from the chapel’s altarpiece and rushed out after the Turkish slave ship, saved the boy from the terrified corsairs and rode back to the chapel, delivering the lad safe and sound to his delighted mother. After this miraculous sally, San Dimitri returned to his original position in the picture. Local people insist that his horse left hoof marks on the rocks around the chapel. The other two legends relate how a massive earthquake drove the land on which the former chapel stood into the sea. However, the chapel miraculously did not crumble and the oil lamp continued to burn in the depths. The legend claims that fishermen sometimes see the oil lamp still flickering down on the seabed. A similar legend narrates how two sailors, who dived from a ship anchored nearby to try to free their blocked anchor, came up to narrate how they had seen a chapel in which an oil lamp was burning! The present chapel, built between 1736 and 1809, is well looked after by the members of a lay religious society based in L-Għarb.]]>"
