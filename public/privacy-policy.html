            <li><strong>Advanced encryption:</strong> All user passwords are encrypted using bcrypt, the industry gold standard for password security</li>
            <li><strong>Unbreakable security:</strong> Even if someone gains access to our database, passwords remain secure and cannot be reverse-engineered</li>
            <li><strong>Zero breach risk:</strong> Passwords are hashed with military-grade encryption that makes them virtually impossible to crack</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Account Protection</h3>

            <li><strong>Brute force prevention:</strong> Our system automatically limits login attempts to prevent unauthorized access attempts</li>
            <li><strong>Rate limiting:</strong> Only 5 login attempts are allowed per IP address every 15 minutes, protecting your account from automated attacks</li>
            <li><strong>Session security:</strong> Every login is tracked and validated through secure session management</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-layered authentication:</strong> Multiple security checks ensure only authorized users can access accounts</li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong>HTTPS encryption:</strong> All data transmitted between your device and our servers is encrypted using TLS/SSL</li>
            <li><strong>CORS protection:</strong> Strict origin controls ensure only authorized websites can communicate with our API</li>
            <li><strong>CSRF protection:</strong> Cross-site request forgery protection prevents unauthorized commands from other websites</li>
            <li><strong>Security headers:</strong> Multiple security headers protect against common web attacks including XSS and clickjacking</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Access Controls</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strict authentication:</strong> All administrative access requires multi-factor authentication</li>
            <li><strong>Role-based access:</strong> Data access is restricted based on user roles and permissions</li>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Security Standards Compliance:</strong> Our security measures address the OWASP Top 10 security risks and follow industry best practices used by major technology companies. We continuously update our security measures to protect against emerging threats.</p>
        </div>
